This file describes the Viterbi trace format, using the example
vit_trace_dict_v04.txt as an illustrative example.

The trace format is:
    The trace dictionary
    The stream of trace time-step entries.

The trace dictionary is defined as follows:
   <n> = number of dictionary entries (message types)
 For each dictionary entry:
   n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 : OFDM parms: 
   m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 : FRAME parms:
   x1 x2 x3 ...   : The message bits (input to decode routine)

Then after all dictionary entries, there is a stream of per-time-step, per-lane status indicators:
   t1_0 t2_0 t3_0 : Message per-lane (t1 = left, t2 = middle, t3 = right) for time step 0
   t1_1 t2_1 t3_1 : Message per-lane (t1 = left, t2 = middle, t3 = right) for time step 1

Each time-step of the trace, the viterbi_iterate routines reads in the trace values for the left, middle and right lanes
(i.e. which message if the autonomous car is in the left, middle or right lane).
WE MUST KNOW WHICH LANE'S TRACE TO USE THIS TIME STEP otherwise we can report inconsistent state
[ Should the car's lane be an input or a global variable? We currently assume a global: GLOBAL_CURRENT_LANE = 0, 1, 2 (left, middle right) ]

The exmaple vit_trace_desc_v04.txt reads as follows (annotated here with some comments)
4   	    - There are 4 messages in the dictionary:
1 48 24 0 13  	    - The OFDM paramteers for the first message (which is "Msg0")
32 12 10 576 288    - The FRAME parameters for the first message (which is "Msg0")
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ... - The input bits for the first message (last bit ENDs this dictionary entry)
1 48 24 0 13  	    - The OFDM paramteers for the second message (which is "Msg1")
32 12 10 576 288    - The FRAME parameters for the second message (which is "Msg1")
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ... - The input bits for the second message (last bit ENDs this dictionary entry)
...
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ... - The input bits for the fourth message (last bit ENDs this and all dictionary entries)
Then the trace:
